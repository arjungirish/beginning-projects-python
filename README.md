# Python Projects
Has programs called "character_integer_counter", "prime_number_detector", "password_analyzer", "rock_paper_scissors", "fibonacci_sequence", "hangman", and "clustering_helpful_to_classifying" (all in python).

Character integer counter asks the user to input a sentence and outputs how many characters, spaces and numbers there were in the sentence.

Prime number detector asks the user to input a number and outputs whether it is prime or not.

Password analyzer asks the user for a password and outputs whether the password is strong or what the user needs to do to make it stronger.

Rock paper scissors asks the user for either rock, paper or scisssors and outputs whether the user won lost or tied against the computer. If the user tied, the game will continue until there isn't a tie.

Fibonacci sequence asks the user for a number as an input and outputs that many numbers in the fibonacci sequence.

Hangman asks player 1 for a word and asks player 2 to guess letters that are in it. Right letters are displayed and only 5 wrong letters are allowed.

Clustering helpful to classifying is a jupyter notebook, hence the different file ending. It is a machine learning project in which I determine whether clustering helps the accuracy of data which already has labels, so doesn't technically need clustering. I find out that clustering doesn't actually prove useful in these cases (at least in the case that I tried out).
